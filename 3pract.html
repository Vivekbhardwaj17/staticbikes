<center><strong>The initial concept of MIS was to process <br>data from the organization and present it in the
for of reports at regular intervals. <br>The system was largely capable of handling the data
from collection to processing.</strong> </br>It was more impersonal, requiring each individual to pick
and choose the processed data and<br> use it for his requirements. This concept was further
modified when a distinction was made <br>between data and information. The information is
a product of an analysis of data.</center>
